Initializing Privy

In your project, import the PrivyProvider component and wrap your app with it. The PrivyProvider must wrap any component or page that will use the Privy React SDK, and it is generally recommended to render it as close to the root of your application as possible.

import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(

    <PrivyProvider
      appId="your-privy-app-id"
      clientId="your-app-client-id"
      config={{
        // Create embedded wallets for users who don't have a wallet
        embeddedWallets: {
          solana: {
            createOnLogin: 'users-without-wallets'
          }
        }
      }}

);
To use external Solana wallets, you must pass toSolanaWalletConnectors() to the externalWallets prop in your PrivyProvider config. Learn more here.

Waiting for Privy to be ready

When the PrivyProvider is first rendered on your page, the Privy SDK will initialize some state about the current user. This might include checking if the user has a wallet connected, refreshing expired auth tokens, fetching up-to-date user data, and more.

It’s important to wait until the PrivyProvider has finished initializing before you consume Privy’s state and interfaces, to ensure that the state you consume is accurate and not stale.

To determine whether the Privy SDK has fully initialized on your page, check the ready Boolean returned by the usePrivy hook. When ready is true, Privy has completed initialization, and your app can consume Privy’s state and interfaces.

import {usePrivy} from '@privy-io/react-auth';

function YourComponent() {
  const {ready} = usePrivy();

  if (!ready) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  // Now it's safe to use other Privy hooks and state
  return <div>Privy is ready!</div>;
}
