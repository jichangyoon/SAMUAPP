Quickstart
Learn how to authenticate users, create embedded wallets, and send transactions in your React app

​
0. Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you have completed the Setup guide.

​
1. Enable a user to log in via email
This quickstart guide will demonstrate how to authenticate a user with a one time password as an example, but Privy supports many authentication methods. Explore our Authentication docs to learn about other methods such as socials, passkeys, and external wallets to authenticate users in your app.

To authenticate a user via their email address, use the React SDK’s useLoginWithEmail hook.


Copy

Ask AI
import {useLoginWithEmail} from '@privy-io/react-auth';
...
const {sendCode, loginWithCode} = useLoginWithEmail();
Ensure that this hook is mounted in a component that is wrapped by the PrivyProvider. You can use the returned methods sendCode and loginWithCode to authenticate your user per the instructions below.

​
Send an OTP
Send a one-time passcode (OTP) to the user’s email by passing their email address to the sendCode method returned from useLoginWithEmail:


Copy

Ask AI
import {useState} from 'react';
import {useLoginWithEmail} from '@privy-io/react-auth';

export default function LoginWithEmail() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [code, setCode] = useState('');
  const {sendCode, loginWithCode} = useLoginWithEmail();

  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.currentTarget.value)} value={email} />
      <button onClick={() => sendCode({email})}>Send Code</button>
      <input onChange={(e) => setCode(e.currentTarget.value)} value={code} />
      <button onClick={() => loginWithCode({code})}>Login</button>
    </div>
  );
}
​
2. Create an embedded wallet for the user
Your app can configure Privy to automatically create wallets for your users as part of their login flow. The embedded wallet will be generated and linked to the user object upon authentication.

Alternatively your app can manually create wallets for users when required.

Privy can provision wallets for your users on both Ethereum and Solana.
​
3. Send a transaction with the embedded wallet
EVM
Solana
With the users’ embedded wallet, your application can now prompt the user to sign and send transactions.


Copy

Ask AI
import {useSendTransaction} from '@privy-io/react-auth';
export default function SendTransactionButton() {
  const {sendTransaction} = useSendTransaction();
  const onSendTransaction = async () => {
    sendTransaction({
      to: '0xE3070d3e4309afA3bC9a6b057685743CF42da77C',
      value: 100000
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={onSendTransaction}>Send Transaction</button>;
}

Congratulations, you have successfully been able to integrate Privy authentication and wallet into your React application!
